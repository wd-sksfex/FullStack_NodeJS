        This is line two and it is in another line and it is separated by using br tag.
        <br>
        The br is a single sided tag and we cannot put any data inside those tags.

    <p>
        Paragraph, headings, etc are all block tags as they contain their own block. They will block entire horizontal strip.
        <br>
        The italic, bold, strikethrough, etc are all Inline Tags and they don't have block by default. They will not block the entire horizontal strip
